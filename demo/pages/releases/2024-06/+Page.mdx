## Improved Nested Layouts

Vike now has first-class support for nested layouts.

```yaml
# Outer layout, common to all pages
pages/+Layout.js
# Layout for product page
pages/product/@id/+Layout.js
# Nested layout
pages/product/@id/pricing/+Page.js
# Nested layout
pages/product/@id/reviews/+Page.js
```

> Fetching data in outer layouts is work-in-progress, see [#1689 - [Nested Layouts] Fetch data on layout-level](https://github.com/vikejs/vike/issues/1689).

## `pages/(marketing)/`

You can now organize your pages into groups:

```yaml
FILESYSTEM                             URL
================================       ==================
pages/(marketing)/index/+Page.js       /
pages/(marketing)/about/+Page.js       /about
pages/admin-panel/index/+Page.js       /admin-panel
pages/admin-panel/users/+Page.js       /admin-panel/users
```
> The directory `(marketing)` is ignored because it's wrapped by parentheses.

Beyond improved organization, it allows you to apply different configurations to different pages.
